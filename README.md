# Obsidian MCP Plugin

> **üìã Community Plugin Status**: This plugin is currently under review for inclusion in the Obsidian Community Plugins directory. Submitted on July 10, 2025 - [PR #6991](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/pull/6991)

A high-performance Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implemented as an Obsidian plugin, providing AI tools with direct vault access through HTTP transport.

## Overview

This plugin brings MCP capabilities directly into Obsidian, eliminating the need for external servers or the REST API plugin. It provides semantic, AI-optimized operations that consolidate multiple tools into intelligent workflows with contextual hints.

### What are "Semantic Tools"?

Unlike basic tools that just return data, semantic tools are **self-guiding**. When an AI agent uses a semantic tool, it doesn't just get the requested information‚Äîit also receives smart suggestions about what to do next. This creates a natural workflow where each action leads intelligently to the next, helping AI agents complete complex tasks without getting stuck or needing constant human guidance.

**Example**: When searching for a file, a semantic tool doesn't just return search results. It also suggests: "Found 3 files matching 'meeting notes'. Consider using `view` to read the most recent one, or `graph traverse` to explore related documents."

### Key Features

- **Direct Obsidian Integration**: Runs natively within Obsidian for maximum performance
- **HTTP MCP Transport**: Compatible with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cline, and other MCP clients
- **Semantic Operations**: Enhanced search with Obsidian operators, intelligent fragment retrieval, and workflow guidance
- **No External Dependencies**: No need for the REST API plugin or external servers
- **High Performance**: Sub-100ms response times with direct vault access
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Support for multiple AI agents working simultaneously (v0.5.8+)
- **Worker Thread Processing**: CPU-intensive operations run in parallel threads for non-blocking performance
- **Path Exclusions**: `.mcpignore` file support for blocking sensitive files from AI access
- **Cloud Sync Friendly**: Smart retry logic handles file sync delays from iCloud, OneDrive, Dropbox, and other services

## üîê Path Exclusions with .mcpignore

Protect sensitive files and directories from AI access using `.gitignore`-style patterns.

### Overview

The plugin supports a `.mcpignore` file in your vault root that allows you to exclude specific files and directories from MCP operations. This provides a security layer ensuring that AI tools cannot access your private or sensitive content.

### Setup

1. **Enable in Settings**: Toggle "Enable Path Exclusions (.mcpignore)" in plugin settings
2. **Create Template**: Click "Create Template" to generate a starter `.mcpignore` file with examples
3. **Edit Patterns**: Use any text editor to add exclusion patterns

### Pattern Syntax

The `.mcpignore` file uses the same syntax as `.gitignore`:

```
# Directories
private/              # Excludes 'private' directory and ALL its contents
/private/            # Only excludes 'private' at vault root
work/*/confidential/ # Excludes 'confidential' dirs one level under work/

# Files
secrets.md           # Excludes this specific file
*.private           # All files ending with .private
daily/*.md          # All .md files directly in daily/

# Negation (whitelist)
!public.private     # Allow this specific file despite *.private rule
```

### Features

- **Auto-reload**: Changes to `.mcpignore` take effect immediately
- **Context Menu**: Right-click any file/folder and select "Add to .mcpignore"
- **UI Controls**: Manage from plugin settings with quick access buttons
- **Security**: Blocked paths return `PATH_BLOCKED` errors with no data leakage
- **Protected**: The `.mcpignore` file itself cannot be accessed via MCP

### Example .mcpignore

```
# Personal content
journal/
diary/
private/

# Work files
work/confidential/
clients/*/contracts/

# Temporary files
*.tmp
*.backup
.#*

# Allow specific files
!work/public-docs/
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Sync Friendly

The plugin gracefully handles sync delays and file locking from cloud storage services.

### Supported Services

Works automatically with:
- **iCloud Drive** - Handles `.icloud` sync artifacts and timing conflicts
- **OneDrive** - Manages file locks and sync delays
- **Dropbox** - Handles sync markers and temporary files
- **Google Drive** - Manages sync state transitions
- **Any sync service** - Universal retry logic works with all platforms

### How It Works

The plugin automatically:
1. **Detects sync conflicts** - Recognizes EEXIST, EBUSY, and "file already exists" errors
2. **Retries intelligently** - Uses exponential backoff (500ms ‚Üí 1s ‚Üí 2s)
3. **Resolves timing issues** - Allows sync services time to complete operations
4. **Works transparently** - No configuration needed, just works

### Benefits

- **No phantom files** - Resolves "file already exists" errors for non-existent files
- **Reliable operations** - File creation, updates, and deletes work consistently
- **Zero configuration** - Automatic detection and handling
- **Cross-platform** - Same behavior on macOS, Windows, and Linux

## Configuration

1. **Enable the Server**:
   - Go to plugin settings
   - Toggle "Enable HTTP Server" 
   - Default port is 3001 (configurable)

2. **Connect Your MCP Client**:

   ### Claude Code
   ```bash
   claude mcp add obsidian http://localhost:3001/mcp --transport http
   ```

   ### Claude Desktop / Other Clients
   
   **Option 1: Direct HTTP Transport** (if your client supports it)
   
   For HTTP (default):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "obsidian": {
         "transport": {
           "type": "http",
           "url": "http://localhost:3001/mcp"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   
   For HTTPS (requires proper certificate trust):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "obsidian": {
         "transport": {
           "type": "http",
           "url": "https://localhost:3443/mcp"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   Note: Direct HTTPS transport may not work with self-signed certificates. Use Option 2 with mcp-remote for HTTPS.
   
   **Option 2: Via mcp-remote** (recommended for Claude Desktop)
   
   Since Claude Desktop might not support streaming HTTP transport yet, use mcp-remote:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "obsidian-vault-name": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": [
           "mcp-remote",
           "http://localhost:3001/mcp"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   
   **‚ö†Ô∏è Important for HTTPS**: If using HTTPS (port 3443) with self-signed certificates, you MUST add the `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` environment variable. See the [HTTPS/TLS Configuration](#httpstls-configuration-v090) section below for details.

   Configuration file locations:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   
   **Windows Note**: If you encounter command line parsing errors with the Authorization header, use this format instead:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "obsidian-vault-name": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": [
           "mcp-remote",
           "http://localhost:3001/mcp",
           "--header",
           "Authorization:${AUTH}"
         ],
         "env": {
           "AUTH": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   This avoids Windows command line issues with spaces in arguments.

### HTTPS/TLS Configuration (v0.9.0+)

The plugin supports secure HTTPS connections with both self-signed and CA-signed certificates, making it ideal for various deployment scenarios including Docker containers and headless servers.

#### Certificate Options

1. **Self-Signed Certificates (Default)**:
   - Auto-generated on first launch
   - Stored in `.obsidian/plugins/semantic-vault-mcp/certificates/`
   - Valid for 1 year with localhost/127.0.0.1 SANs
   - Perfect for local development

2. **Custom CA-Signed Certificates**:
   - Provide your own certificate and key files
   - Ideal for production environments, Docker containers, or headless servers
   - No client-side certificate trust workarounds needed
   - Supports standard PEM format certificates

#### Configuration Steps

1. **Enable HTTPS in Plugin Settings**:
   - Go to plugin settings in Obsidian
   - Find "HTTPS/TLS Settings" section
   - Toggle "Enable HTTPS Server"
   - Default HTTPS port is 3443 (auto-increments if in use)
   
   **For Custom Certificates**:
   - Clear the auto-generated certificate paths
   - Enter paths to your certificate and key files
   - Supported formats: `.pem`, `.crt`, `.key`

2. **Configure Claude Code / MCP Client**:

   **For Self-Signed Certificates**:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "obsidian-vault-name": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": [
           "mcp-remote",
           "https://localhost:3443/mcp",
           "--header",
           "Authorization:${AUTH}"
         ],
         "env": {
           "NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED": "0",
           "AUTH": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   Note: The `env` section is required for self-signed certificates. The Authorization header uses `${AUTH}` to avoid Windows command line issues.

   **For CA-Signed Certificates**:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "obsidian-vault-name": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": [
           "mcp-remote",
           "https://your-domain.com:3443/mcp",
           "--header",
           "Authorization:${AUTH}"
         ],
         "env": {
           "AUTH": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   Note: No `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` needed - the certificate is trusted by default.

#### Docker & Headless Deployment

The HTTPS support is particularly useful for running Obsidian in headless environments:

1. **Docker Container Setup**:
   ```dockerfile
   # Mount your certificates into the container
   VOLUME ["/certs"]
   
   # Configure plugin to use mounted certificates
   # Set certificate paths in plugin settings:
   # - Certificate Path: /certs/server.crt
   # - Key Path: /certs/server.key
   ```

2. **Benefits for Headless Environments**:
   - Secure remote access to your Obsidian vault
   - No GUI needed for certificate configuration
   - Proper TLS encryption for production deployments
   - Compatible with reverse proxies and load balancers

3. **Example Docker Compose**:
   ```yaml
   services:
     obsidian:
       image: your-obsidian-image
       ports:
         - "3443:3443"
       volumes:
         - ./certs:/certs:ro
         - ./vault:/vault
       environment:
         - OBSIDIAN_CERT_PATH=/certs/server.crt
         - OBSIDIAN_KEY_PATH=/certs/server.key
   ```

#### Certificate Management Tips

1. **Generate a Proper Certificate with Let's Encrypt**:
   ```bash
   certbot certonly --standalone -d your-domain.com
   # Certificates will be in /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/
   ```

2. **Create a Self-Signed Certificate Manually**:
   ```bash
   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem \
     -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=localhost"
   ```

3. **Certificate Requirements**:
   - Must be in PEM format
   - Private key should not be password-protected
   - Include proper SANs for your domain/IP

4. **Security Considerations**:
   - Use CA-signed certificates for production
   - Self-signed certificates are suitable for local development only
   - Keep private keys secure and never commit them to version control
   - Rotate certificates before expiration

### Concurrent Sessions for Agent Swarms (v0.5.8+)

Enable multiple AI agents to work with your vault simultaneously without blocking each other:

1. **Enable in Settings**:
   - Go to plugin settings
   - Find "Concurrent Sessions" section
   - Toggle "Enable Concurrent Sessions for Agent Swarms"
   - Adjust max connections if needed (default: 32)

2. **Architecture**:
   - Each AI session gets its own isolated MCP server instance
   - True parallel processing - no blocking between sessions
   - Automatic session management with 1-hour timeout
   - Session reuse for reconnecting clients

3. **Monitor Active Sessions**:
   - Use the `obsidian://session-info` resource to view:
     - Active sessions with "This is you!" indicator
     - Session age, idle time, and request counts
     - Server pool utilization statistics

4. **Use Cases**:
   - Multiple Claude instances working on different parts of your vault
   - AI agent teams collaborating on research or writing projects
   - Parallel processing of large knowledge bases
   - Non-blocking operation for time-sensitive workflows

- **`obsidian://session-info`** - Active sessions and connection pool statistics (when concurrent sessions enabled)

## Key Improvements Over External MCP Servers

1. **Performance**: Direct vault access eliminates HTTP overhead
2. **Search**: Uses Obsidian's native search with advanced operators
3. **Integration**: Access to full Obsidian API and plugin ecosystem
4. **Simplicity**: Single plugin installation, no external dependencies
5. **Reliability**: No separate processes to manage or crash

## Architecture

This plugin implements the same semantic operations as [obsidian-semantic-mcp](https://github.com/aaronsb/obsidian-semantic-mcp) but runs directly within Obsidian:

```
Before: AI Tool ‚Üí MCP Server ‚Üí REST API Plugin ‚Üí Obsidian
Now:    AI Tool ‚Üí MCP Plugin (within Obsidian)
```

The critical `ObsidianAPI` abstraction layer is preserved, allowing all semantic operations to work identically while gaining the performance benefits of direct integration.

```

## Troubleshooting

### Tools Not Appearing in Claude Desktop

If the MCP server connects but no tools appear in Claude Desktop:

1. **Check your configuration URL**: Make sure you're using the correct protocol and port
   - HTTP: `http://localhost:3001/mcp`
   - HTTPS: `https://localhost:3443/mcp`

2. **For HTTPS with self-signed certificates**: You MUST add `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED`:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "obsidian-vault": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://localhost:3443/mcp"],
         "env": {
           "NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED": "0"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Restart Claude Desktop** after any configuration changes

### Windows: "Program is not recognized" Error

If you see `'D:\Program' is not recognized...` on Windows with Node.js in Program Files:

**Solution**: Use the full path to npx.cmd from your npm global directory:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "obsidian-vault": {
      "command": "C:\\Users\\[YOUR_USERNAME]\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\npx.cmd",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "http://localhost:3001/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Connection Timeouts

If you experience connection timeouts:
- Ensure the plugin is enabled in Obsidian settings
- Check that the MCP server is running (look for the status in plugin settings)
- Verify no firewall is blocking the ports (3001 for HTTP, 3443 for HTTPS)
- Try using HTTP first to rule out certificate issues
