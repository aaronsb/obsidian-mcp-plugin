# Obsidian MCP Plugin

A high-performance Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implemented as an Obsidian plugin, providing AI tools with direct vault access through HTTP transport.

## Overview

This plugin brings MCP capabilities directly into Obsidian, eliminating the need for external servers or the REST API plugin. It provides semantic, AI-optimized operations that consolidate multiple tools into intelligent workflows with contextual hints.

### Key Features

- **Direct Obsidian Integration**: Runs natively within Obsidian for maximum performance
- **HTTP MCP Transport**: Compatible with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cline, and other MCP clients
- **Semantic Operations**: Enhanced search with Obsidian operators, intelligent fragment retrieval, and workflow guidance
- **No External Dependencies**: No need for the REST API plugin or external servers
- **High Performance**: Sub-100ms response times with direct vault access
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Support for multiple AI agents working simultaneously (v0.5.8+)
- **Worker Thread Processing**: CPU-intensive operations run in parallel threads for non-blocking performance

> **Note**: This plugin is currently pending review for the Obsidian Community Plugins directory. Until approved, please use the BRAT installation method below.

### Current Installation: Via BRAT (Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool)

Since this plugin is not yet in the Community Plugins directory, you'll need to use BRAT to install it:

1. **Install BRAT**:
   - Open Obsidian Settings ‚Üí Community Plugins
   - Browse and search for "BRAT"
   - Install and enable the [BRAT plugin](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat)

2. **Add This Plugin**:
   - In Obsidian settings, go to BRAT settings
   - Click "Add Beta Plugin"
   - Enter: `aaronsb/obsidian-mcp-plugin`
   - Click "Add Plugin"

3. **Enable the Plugin**:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Community Plugins
   - Find "Obsidian MCP Plugin" and enable it
   - The plugin will auto-update through BRAT

### Future Installation: Via Community Plugins (After Approval)

Once this plugin is approved and available in the Obsidian Community Plugins directory:

1. Open Obsidian Settings ‚Üí Community Plugins
2. Click "Browse" and search for "MCP"
3. Find "Obsidian MCP Plugin" by Aaron Bockelie
4. Click "Install" then "Enable"

> **For BRAT Users**: After the plugin is approved, you can remove it from BRAT and install it normally through Community Plugins to receive standard updates.

## Configuration

1. **Enable the Server**:
   - Go to plugin settings
   - Toggle "Enable HTTP Server" 
   - Default port is 3001 (configurable)

2. **Connect Your MCP Client**:

   ### Claude Code
   ```bash
   claude mcp add obsidian http://localhost:3001/mcp --transport http
   ```

   ### Claude Desktop / Other Clients
   Add to your configuration file:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "obsidian": {
         "transport": {
           "type": "http",
           "url": "http://localhost:3001/mcp"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Configuration file locations:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

### Concurrent Sessions for Agent Swarms (v0.5.8+)

Enable multiple AI agents to work with your vault simultaneously without blocking each other:

1. **Enable in Settings**:
   - Go to plugin settings
   - Find "Concurrent Sessions" section
   - Toggle "Enable Concurrent Sessions for Agent Swarms"
   - Adjust max connections if needed (default: 32)

2. **Architecture**:
   - Each AI session gets its own isolated MCP server instance
   - True parallel processing - no blocking between sessions
   - Automatic session management with 1-hour timeout
   - Session reuse for reconnecting clients

3. **Monitor Active Sessions**:
   - Use the `obsidian://session-info` resource to view:
     - Active sessions with "This is you!" indicator
     - Session age, idle time, and request counts
     - Server pool utilization statistics

4. **Use Cases**:
   - Multiple Claude instances working on different parts of your vault
   - AI agent teams collaborating on research or writing projects
   - Parallel processing of large knowledge bases
   - Non-blocking operation for time-sensitive workflows

### Concurrent Sessions (v0.5.8+)

The plugin supports multiple AI agents working simultaneously through session-based connection pooling:

- Each MCP client gets a unique session ID
- Sessions are isolated and tracked independently
- CPU-intensive operations (search, graph traversal) can run in parallel
- Worker threads prevent blocking the main Obsidian UI
- Sessions automatically expire after 1 hour of inactivity

**Performance with Concurrent Sessions**:
- Up to 32 simultaneous operations (configurable)
- Worker threads for CPU-intensive tasks
- Non-blocking UI during heavy operations
- Automatic session cleanup and resource management

## MCP Resources

- **`obsidian://vault-info`** - Real-time vault metadata including file counts, active file, and plugin status
- **`obsidian://session-info`** - Active sessions and connection pool statistics (when concurrent sessions enabled)

## Key Improvements Over External MCP Servers

1. **Performance**: Direct vault access eliminates HTTP overhead
2. **Search**: Uses Obsidian's native search with advanced operators
3. **Integration**: Access to full Obsidian API and plugin ecosystem
4. **Simplicity**: Single plugin installation, no external dependencies
5. **Reliability**: No separate processes to manage or crash

## Architecture

This plugin implements the same semantic operations as [obsidian-semantic-mcp](https://github.com/aaronsb/obsidian-semantic-mcp) but runs directly within Obsidian:

```
Before: AI Tool ‚Üí MCP Server ‚Üí REST API Plugin ‚Üí Obsidian
Now:    AI Tool ‚Üí MCP Plugin (within Obsidian)
```

The critical `ObsidianAPI` abstraction layer is preserved, allowing all semantic operations to work identically while gaining the performance benefits of direct integration.

## Testing Status

‚úÖ **Working Features**:
- All 6 semantic tools with all actions
- Enhanced search with Obsidian operators
- Graph traversal and link analysis
- Image viewing and file operations
- Fragment retrieval for large files
- Workflow hints and guidance
- Multi-vault support
- Port collision detection
- Cross-platform tested (Linux, Windows, macOS)

‚ö° **Performance Results**:
- File operations: <10ms (vs ~50-100ms with REST API)
- Search operations: <50ms (vs ~100-300ms)
- Zero network overhead
