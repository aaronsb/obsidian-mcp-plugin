- [ ] Implement SSL certificate handling
- [ ] Add CORS support for web clients
- [ ] Create server start/stop lifecycle management

#### 2.2 REST API Endpoints
- [ ] Implement all vault endpoints (`/vault/*`)
- [ ] Implement active file endpoints (`/active`)
- [ ] Implement search endpoint (`/search/simple`)
- [ ] Implement utility endpoints (`/open/*`, `/commands/*`)
- [ ] Add authentication middleware

#### 2.3 Compatibility Testing
- [ ] Test against existing REST API client code
- [ ] Verify response format compatibility
- [ ] Benchmark performance vs HTTP-based approach
- [ ] Test error handling and edge cases

**Deliverable**: Plugin provides full REST API compatibility with performance improvements

**Testing**: Automated tests against all REST endpoints

## Phase 3: MCP Server Integration (Week 3)

### Goal: Embedded MCP server with existing semantic operations

#### 3.1 MCP Protocol Implementation
- [ ] Integrate MCP server framework within plugin
- [ ] Add HTTP transport for MCP protocol
- [ ] Copy semantic router from obsidian-semantic-mcp
- [ ] Integrate fragment retrieval system
- [ ] Add workflow hint generation

#### 3.2 Semantic Operations Migration
- [ ] Port all vault operations (list, read, create, update, delete, search)
- [ ] Port all edit operations (window, append, patch, from_buffer)
- [ ] Port all view operations (file, window, active, open_in_obsidian)
- [ ] Port workflow and system operations
- [ ] Implement enhanced search with snippets and media file discovery

#### 3.3 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Replace all HTTP calls in semantic operations with direct API calls
- [ ] Optimize fragment retrieval for direct vault access
- [ ] Implement caching layer for frequently accessed files
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and metrics

**Deliverable**: Plugin provides both REST and MCP protocols with enhanced search capabilities

**Testing**: Full MCP protocol testing with existing client tools

## Phase 4: Enhancement and Polish (Week 4)

### Goal: Advanced features and production readiness

#### 4.1 Advanced Obsidian Integration
- [ ] Add real-time file change notifications
- [ ] Integrate with Obsidian's internal search (if available)
- [ ] Add plugin ecosystem integration hooks (Dataview, etc.)
- [ ] Implement workspace manipulation capabilities
- [ ] Add tag and metadata extraction

#### 4.2 User Experience Improvements
- [ ] Create comprehensive settings UI
- [ ] Add status indicators and health monitoring
- [ ] Implement troubleshooting diagnostics
- [ ] Add performance metrics dashboard
- [ ] Create user-friendly error messages

#### 4.3 Documentation and Examples
- [ ] Write complete user documentation
- [ ] Create migration guide from existing setups
- [ ] Document API compatibility
- [ ] Provide configuration examples
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide

**Deliverable**: Production-ready plugin with advanced features and documentation

**Testing**: Comprehensive integration testing and user acceptance testing

## Phase 5: Community Testing (Week 5-6)

### Goal: BRAT testing and community feedback

#### 5.1 BRAT Preparation
- [ ] Prepare GitHub repository for BRAT
- [ ] Create release with proper plugin assets
- [ ] Write installation instructions for BRAT users
- [ ] Set up issue tracking and feedback collection
- [ ] Create beta testing guidelines

#### 5.2 Community Engagement
- [ ] Announce beta testing in Obsidian community
- [ ] Collect and prioritize feedback
- [ ] Fix critical issues discovered during testing
- [ ] Iterate on user experience improvements
- [ ] Performance optimization based on real usage

#### 5.3 Stability and Performance
- [ ] Stress testing with large vaults
- [ ] Memory leak testing during extended operation
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility testing
- [ ] Mobile Obsidian compatibility assessment
- [ ] Plugin conflict testing

**Deliverable**: Stable, community-tested plugin ready for official release

**Testing**: Real-world usage by beta testers with feedback integration
