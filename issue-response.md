Hi @[reporter],

Thank you for the detailed bug report! I've identified and fixed the issue in version 0.5.10.

## Root Cause

The problem was a parameter name mismatch between the semantic tool definition and the underlying API implementation:

- The MCP tool expected parameters named `oldText` and `newText` (camelCase)
- The `patchVaultFile` method was looking for `old_text` and `new_text` (snake_case)
- Additionally, the semantic router wasn't passing these parameters through to the API at all

This caused the patch operation to silently fail - it would return `success: true` but wouldn't actually modify the file because the required parameters were missing.

## The Fix

In version 0.5.10, I've updated the semantic router to properly pass the `oldText` and `newText` parameters to the `patchVaultFile` method:

```typescript
case 'patch':
  return await this.api.patchVaultFile(params.path, {
    operation: params.operation,
    targetType: params.targetType,
    target: params.target,
    content: params.content,
    old_text: params.oldText,    // Added these mappings
    new_text: params.newText     // Added these mappings
  });
```

## Testing

I've verified the fix works correctly:

```json
// Before (v0.5.9):
Request: {"action": "patch", "operation": "replace", "oldText": "original", "newText": "modified"}
Response: {"success": true} // But file unchanged

// After (v0.5.10):
Request: {"action": "patch", "operation": "replace", "oldText": "original", "newText": "modified"}
Response: {"success": true, "updated_content": "...modified..."} // File actually updated
```

## Update Instructions

1. Update to version 0.5.10 via BRAT
2. Restart Obsidian or disable/enable the plugin
3. The patch operation should now work as expected

Thank you again for reporting this issue. The patch operation originated from an early implementation that wasn't fully integrated with our semantic hints system, which is why it was overlooked during testing.

Please let me know if you encounter any other issues!
